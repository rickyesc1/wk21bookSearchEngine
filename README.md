# Book Search Engine 

This is a MERN-style application that was given to us as a Restful API and we were tasked with refactoring the perfectly working starter code into a Graph QL style API. 
The point/motivation behind the app itself is to allow a user to be able to search for any books found on google (using the google books search API) as per the User Story.

## User Story:

```md
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```
## How to use:

- Signup by clicking on the button in the top right and then creating a profile
- Login using the information that you provided
- Search for any book using the search bar
- Click on the book/link for more information
- Save books to your My Books Collection

## Technology Used

- React
- React Router
- Apollo Server and Apollo Boost
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
- Express
- Node

## Task:

1. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

2. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

3. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

4. Deploy your application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas. Use the [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/deploy-with-heroku-and-mongodb-atlas) walkthrough for instructions.


* `auth.js`: Update the auth middleware function to work with the GraphQL API.

* `server.js`: Implement the Apollo Server and apply it to the Express server as middleware.

	> **Important**: Apollo Server recently migrated to Apollo Server 3. This major-version release impacts how Apollo Server interacts in an Express environment. To implement Apollo Server 2 as demonstrated in the activities, you **MUST** use the following script `npm install apollo-server-express@2.15.0` to install Apollo Server 2. Alternately, to migrate to the latest version of Apollo Server, please refer to the [Apollo Server Docs on Migrating to Apollo Server 3](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/migration/#nodejs) and [Apollo Server Docs on Implementing Apollo Server Express with v3](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/middleware/#apollo-server-express). Note that if you are using Apollo Server 3 you are required use `await server.start()` before calling `server.applyMiddleware`.

* `Schemas` directory:

	* `index.js`: Export your typeDefs and resolvers.

	* `resolvers.js`: Define the query and mutation functionality to work with the Mongoose models.

		**Hint**: Use the functionality in the `user-controller.js` as a guide.

	* `typeDefs.js`: Define the necessary `Query` and `Mutation` types:

		* `Query` type:

			* `me`: Which returns a `User` type.
		
		* `Mutation` type:

			* `login`: Accepts an email and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.

			* `addUser`: Accepts a username, email, and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.

			* `saveBook`: Accepts a book author's array, description, title, bookId, image, and link as parameters; returns a `User` type. (Look into creating what's known as an `input` type to handle all of these parameters!)

			* `removeBook`: Accepts a book's `bookId` as a parameter; returns a `User` type.
			
		* `User` type:

			* `_id`

			* `username`

			* `email`

			* `bookCount`

			* `savedBooks` (This will be an array of the `Book` type.)

		* `Book` type:

			* `bookId` (Not the `_id`, but the book's `id` value returned from Google's Book API.)

			* `authors` (An array of strings, as there may be more than one author.)

			* `description`

			* `title`

			* `image`

			* `link`

		* `Auth` type:

			* `token`

			* `user` (References the `User` type.)


### Front-End Specifications

You'll need to create the following front-end files:

* `queries.js`: This will hold the query `GET_ME`, which will execute the `me` query set up using Apollo Server.

* `mutations.js`:

	* `LOGIN_USER` will execute the `loginUser` mutation set up using Apollo Server.

	* `ADD_USER` will execute the `addUser` mutation.

	* `SAVE_BOOK` will execute the `saveBook` mutation.

	* `REMOVE_BOOK` will execute the `removeBook` mutation.

Additionally, you???ll need to complete the following tasks in each of these front-end files:

* `App.js`: Create an Apollo Provider to make every request work with the Apollo Server.
	
* `SearchBooks.js`:

	* Use the Apollo `useMutation()` Hook to execute the `SAVE_BOOK` mutation in the `handleSaveBook()` function instead of the `saveBook()` function imported from the `API` file.

	* Make sure you keep the logic for saving the book's ID to state in the `try...catch` block! 

* `SavedBooks.js`:

	* Remove the `useEffect()` Hook that sets the state for `UserData`.

	* Instead, use the `useQuery()` Hook to execute the `GET_ME` query on load and save it to a variable named `userData`.

	* Use the `useMutation()` Hook to execute the `REMOVE_BOOK` mutation in the `handleDeleteBook()` function instead of the `deleteBook()` function that's imported from `API` file. (Make sure you keep the `removeBookId()` function in place!)

* `SignupForm.js`: Replace the `addUser()` functionality imported from the `API` file with the `ADD_USER` mutation functionality.

* `LoginForm.js`: Replace the `loginUser()` functionality imported from the `API` file with the `LOGIN_USER` mutation functionality.
